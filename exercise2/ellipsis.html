				<p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary<br> 
					time needed to understand your product vision.<br>
					The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work. <br>
					Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces<br> you need.

				<h5>DESIGN</h5>
				<p>Our design practice offers a full range of services including branding strategy,<br>
					interaction and visual design and user experience testing. <br>
					Throughout your project, our designers create and implement visual designs and workflows, <br>
					solicit user feedback, and work with you to make sure what gets built is what is needed.

				<h5>DEVELOPMENT</h5>
				<p>
					All engineers are fluent in the latest enterprise, mobile and web development technologies. <br>
					They collaborate with your team to write, test, and improve code on a daily basis, using proven <br> practices such as test-driven development and pair programing.

				<h5>PRODUCT MANAGEMENT</h5>
				<p>
					 Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, the <br>
					 products we build are always ready to go live. This iterative process allows for changes as<br>
					 business requirements evolve.
